I am interested in the subjects of armed conflicts, terrorism studies, religious politics, as well as political methodologies with more than 2 years of experience in related fields. Previously, I held a couple of research assistant positions in academia and interned at national and international think tanks. Throughout these occasions, I gathered experience in conducting literature reviews, preparing and drafting written works, gathering background information, along with cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data in R and Python. I also occasionally use the MS Excel program for data analysis purposes.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Muhammet Ozkaraca\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              I aspire to be a social scientist.
