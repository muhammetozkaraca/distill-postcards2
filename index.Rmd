I aspire to be a social scientist. I am interested in the subjects of armed conflicts, terrorism studies, religious politics, as well as political methodologies with more than 2 years of experience in related fields. Previously, I held a couple of research assistant positions in academia and interned at national and international think tanks. Throughout these occasions, I gathered experience in conducting literature reviews, preparing and drafting written works, gathering background information, along with cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data in R and Python. I also occasionally use the MS Excel program for data analysis purposes.
